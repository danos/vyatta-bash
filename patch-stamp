dont-report-sigpipe:
  Define DONT_REPORT_SIGPIPE: We don't want to see `Broken pipe' messages
  when a job like `cat jobs.c | exit 1' is executed. Fixes part of #7047,
  #10259, #10433 and #10494. Comment from the upstream author: "The default
  bash behavior with respect to the exit status of a pipeline will not
  change.  Changing it as suggested in the discussion of #10494 would render
  bash incompatible with every other shell out there.".
