Patches applied in this version:

arrayfunc:
  Fix for causing a segmentation fault when some special shell variables
  are declared as array.

bashbug-editor:
  send bug reports to Debian bash maintainer too.

deb-bash-config:
  Changed compile time configuration options:
  
  - Set the default path to comply with Debian policy
  
  - Define DONT_REPORT_SIGPIPE: We don't want to see `Broken pipe' messages
  when a job like `cat jobs.c | exit 1' is executed. Fixes part of #7047,
  #10259, #10433 and #10494. Comment from the upstream author: "The
  default bash behavior with respect to the exit status of a pipeline
  will not change.  Changing it as suggested in the discussion of #10494
  would render bash incompatible with every other shell out there.".
  
  - Enable System-wide .bashrc file for interactive shells.
  
  - Enable System-wide .bash_logout  file for interactive shells.
  
  - make non-interactive shells begun with argv[0][0] == '-'
  run the startup files when not in posix mode.
  
  - try to check whether bash is being run by sshd and source
  the .bashrc if so (like the rshd behavior).

deb-examples:
  document readline header location on Debian systems

man-vx-opts:
  document -v / -x options

man-arithmetic:
  document deprecated syntax for arithmetic evaluation.

man-fignore:
  bash(1): mention quoting when assigning to FIGNORE

privmode:
  XXX missing description
  
  Comment from Chet Ramey <chet@nike.ins.cwru.edu>:
  
  Nope.  This will allow setuid scripts if not called as `sh' and not 
  called with the -p option.  I won't install this. 

random:
  use the system random functions

various:
  a header include change

headers:
  include headers for including function prototypes

kill-group:
  Don't mishandle negative pod in `kill' builtin

service_completion:
  Patch to bash 2.05a to add service completion.
  http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion

rl-examples:
  Modified readline examples to properly build with Debian setup.

rl-symlinked-dirs:
  Taken from the current upstream sources:
  Make the symlinked directory completion behavior introduced in
  readline-4.2a a user-settable option. If `mark-symlinked-directories'
  is non-zero, the symlinked directory completion behavior is disabled,
  and symlinks that point to directories have a slash appended.

rl-inputrc:
  Support for /etc/inputrc in addition to ~/inputrc

rl-del-backspace-policy:
  Patches to handle Debian Backspace/Delete keyboard policy ???
